# C# DLL Injector (WPF, .NET 8.0)

This project is a **C# DLL Injector** built using **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)** and **.NET 8.0**, designed with a modern, clean, and intuitive Windows 11-style user interface. The application provides a robust and efficient way to inject DLLs into selected processes, making it a valuable tool for developers, testers, and researchers working in application testing, debugging, or process interaction.

## Key Features

### 1. Process Selection
- Displays a filtered list of running processes on the user's system, focusing only on user-facing applications like games, Spotify, Discord, etc.
- Excludes system services, drivers, and other unnecessary background processes for a cleaner list.
- Processes are displayed with:
  - **Name**
  - **PID (Process ID)**
  - **Architecture** (x86 or x64)

### 2. DLL Selection
- Allows users to browse and select a DLL file for injection.
- Displays detailed information about the selected DLL, including:
  - File name
  - Full file path
  - File size
  - Creation date
  - Last modified date

### 3. Process Details
- Shows detailed information about the selected process in a dedicated section, including:
  - Process name
  - PID
  - Memory usage
  - Number of threads
  - Priority
  - File path to the executable

### 4. DLL Injection
- Implements the **LoadLibrary injection method**:
  - Allocates memory in the target process.
  - Writes the DLL path into the process memory.
  - Creates a remote thread to execute the DLL using `LoadLibraryA`.
- Supports both x86 and x64 architectures.

### 5. User-Friendly Interface
- Designed with a modern, Windows 11-inspired UI for simplicity and accessibility.
- Features a clean layout with interactive ComboBox, buttons, and rich text boxes for process and DLL details.

## How It Works

1. **Refresh Process List**:
   - Click the **Refresh** button to populate the list of running processes. Only user-facing applications are displayed.

2. **Select a Process**:
   - Choose a process from the ComboBox. The application will display detailed information about the selected process.

3. **Select a DLL**:
   - Click the **Select DLL** button to browse and select the DLL file you wish to inject. The selected DLL's details are displayed.

4. **Inject the DLL**:
   - Click the **Inject** button to perform the injection. The application uses the LoadLibrary method to load the DLL into the selected process.
